# Electricity Bill Generator (C)ðŸ’¡

This is a simple C program to calculate an electricity bill based on:
- Customer name
- Connection type (Domestic or Commercial)
- Units consumed

The program uses a slab-based rate system:
- Domestic:
  - 0â€“100 units â†’ â‚¹1.50/unit
  - 101â€“300 units â†’ â‚¹2.00/unit
  - Above 300 units â†’ â‚¹3.00/unit
- Commercial:
  - 0â€“100 units â†’ â‚¹2.50/unit
  - 101â€“300 units â†’ â‚¹4.00/unit
  - Above 300 units â†’ â‚¹5.00/unit

A fixed meter maintenance charge (â‚¹50) is added to every bill.  
The bill is then displayed in a formatted layout.
